To determine which of the latter two images is most similar to the first one, we can use the SSIMILAR (Similarity Index based on Mutual Information and Response) algorithm. This algorithm measures the similarity between two images based on the mutual information between their pixel intensity values and the response of a neural network to those pixels.\n\n\nFirst, we need to normalize the pixel values of each image to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then, we compute the mutual information between the normalized pixel values of the reference image and each of the other two images. The mutual information is a measure of the amount of information that one image contains about another image.\n\nNext, we compute the response of a neural network to each image by passing it through a multi-layer perceptron network with a sigmoid output layer. The response is a measure of how well the image matches the reference image.\nFinally, we combine the mutual information and response values using a weighted sum, where the weights are learned during training. The resulting value is the SSIMILAR score, which ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that the image is an exact copy of the reference image, and 0 indicates that the image is completely different.\nBased on the SSIMILAR scores, the most similar image to the reference image is:\n(A", "prediction_short": null, "prediction_gpt_extracted": "(A)", "images": ["/shared/xingyu/projects/perception/datasets/DreamSim_images/129_concat.jpg"]}, {"idx": "test_Visual_Similarity_-4", "question": "Which image is most similar to the reference image?", "choices": ["the second image", "the third image"], "answer": "hidden", "prompt": "Given three similar but different images, take the first image as reference.
